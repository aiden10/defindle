# Gameplay
A hint will be revealed after the first 3 incorrect guesses. The first hint reveals the length of the word, the second hint reveals the first letter, and the last hint reveals the last letter.
## Scoring
An incorrect guess subtracts one point. A correct guess with no hints gives 3 points, and each subsequent hint gives one less. The points are shown in the top right. Although it's not particularly balanced since you have the option to just give up.
